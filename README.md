# INI-File-Encrypter-Decrypter
It is a Project to develop and collect INI File Encrypter/Decrypter in many Programming language.

### Why INI File
1. INI Files are used to setup config files.
2. INI File format/syntax is simple and easy to understand.
2. config Files are those files which stores the future changeable entities, we don't have to change the code but just change those entities in config files.
3. Many Programming languages don't support INI files but there are various Libraries available by community.(aim is to collect them all!!)
3. Many Times we want to keep the config file encrypted and when we need to make certain changes we will decrypt it, make changes and re-encrypt before giving it to end users.
